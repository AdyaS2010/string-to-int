# String to Integer Converter!

## Description
This project is a string to integer converter written in C. It takes a string representation of a positive integer (the program ensures that the input is a valid positive integer prior to performing the conversion) as input and converts it to an integer using a recursive function. 

## Features
- Convert a string representation of a positive integer to an integer
- Validate the input to ensure it is a positive integer
- Use a recursive function for the conversion

## Installation

   ```

## Usage
1. Run the application:
